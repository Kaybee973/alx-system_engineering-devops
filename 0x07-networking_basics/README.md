What is networking?
A computer network comprises two or more computers that are connected—either by cables (wired) or wifi (wireless)—with the purpose of transmitting, exchanging, or sharing data and resources.

You build a computer network by using hardware (for example, routers, switches, access points, and cables) and software (for example, operating systems or business applications).
Geographic location often defines a computer network. For example, a LAN (local area network) connects computers in a defined physical space, like an office building, whereas a WAN (wide area network) can connect computers across continents. The internet is the largest example of a WAN, connecting billions of computers worldwide.

You can further define a computer network by the protocols it uses to communicate, the physical arrangement of its components, how it controls traffic, and its purpose.

Computer networks enable communication for every business, entertainment, and research purpose. The internet, online search, email, audio and video sharing, online commerce, live-streaming, and social networks all exist because of computer networks.
