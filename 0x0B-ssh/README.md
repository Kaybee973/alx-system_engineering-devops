Introduction
SSH is a secure protocol used as the primary means of connecting to Linux servers remotely. It provides a text-based interface by spawning a remote shell. After connecting, all commands you type in your local terminal are sent to the remote server and executed there.

In this cheat sheet-style guide, we will cover some common ways of connecting with SSH to achieve your objectives. This can be used as a quick reference when you need to know how to connect to or configure your server in different ways.

SSH Overview
The most common way of connecting to a remote Linux server is through SSH. SSH stands for Secure Shell and provides a safe and secure way of executing commands, making changes, and configuring services remotely. When you connect through SSH, you log in using an account that exists on the remote server.

How SSH Works
When you connect through SSH, you will be dropped into a shell session, which is a text-based interface where you can interact with your server. For the duration of your SSH session, any commands that you type into your local terminal are sent through an encrypted SSH tunnel and executed on your server.

The SSH connection is implemented using a client-server model. This means that for an SSH connection to be established, the remote machine must be running a piece of software called an SSH daemon. This software listens for connections on a specific network port, authenticates connection requests, and spawns the appropriate environment if the user provides the correct credentials.

The user’s computer must have an SSH client. This is a piece of software that knows how to communicate using the SSH protocol and can be given information about the remote host to connect to, the username to use, and the credentials that should be passed to authenticate. The client can also specify certain details about the connection type they would like to establish.

How SSH Authenticates Users
Clients generally authenticate either using passwords (less secure and not recommended) or SSH keys, which are very secure.

Password logins are encrypted and are easy to understand for new users. However, automated bots and malicious users will often repeatedly try to authenticate to accounts that allow password-based logins, which can lead to security compromises. For this reason, we recommend always setting up SSH key-based authentication for most configurations.

SSH keys are a matching set of cryptographic keys which can be used for authentication. Each set contains a public and a private key. The public key can be shared freely without concern, while the private key must be vigilantly guarded and never exposed to anyone.

To authenticate using SSH keys, a user must have an SSH key pair on their local computer. On the remote server, the public key must be copied to a file within the user’s home directory at ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. This file contains a list of public keys, one-per-line, that are authorized to log into this account.

When a client connects to the host, wishing to use SSH key authentication, it will inform the server of this intent and will tell the server which public key to use. The server then checks its authorized_keys file for the public key, generates a random string, and encrypts it using the public key. This encrypted message can only be decrypted with the associated private key. The server will send this encrypted message to the client to test whether they actually have the associated private key.

Upon receipt of this message, the client will decrypt it using the private key and combine the random string that is revealed with a previously negotiated session ID. It then generates an MD5 hash of this value and transmits it back to the server. The server already had the original message and the session ID, so it can compare an MD5 hash generated by those values and determine that the client must have the private key.

Now that you know how SSH works, we can begin to discuss some examples to demonstrate different ways of working with SSH

Generating and Working with SSH Keys
This section will cover how to generate SSH keys on a client machine and distribute the public key to servers where they should be used. This is a good section to start with if you have not previously generated keys due to the increased security that it allows for future connections.

Generating an SSH Key Pair
Generating a new SSH public and private key pair on your local computer is the first step towards authenticating with a remote server without a password. Unless there is a good reason not to, you should always authenticate using SSH keys.

A number of cryptographic algorithms can be used to generate SSH keys, including RSA, DSA, and ECDSA. RSA keys are generally preferred and are the default key type.

To generate an RSA key pair on your local computer, type:

ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa):
This prompt allows you to choose the location to store your RSA private key. Press ENTER to leave this as the default, which will store them in the .ssh hidden directory in your user’s home directory. Leaving the default location selected will allow your SSH client to find the keys automatically.

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
The next prompt allows you to enter an arbitrary length passphrase to secure your private key. As an additional security measure, you will have to enter any passphrase you set here every time you use the private key. Feel free to press ENTER to leave this blank if you do not want a passphrase. Keep in mind, though, that this will allow anyone who gains control of your private key to log in to your servers.

If you choose to enter a passphrase, nothing will be displayed as you type. This is a security precaution.

Output
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
8c:e9:7c:fa:bf:c4:e5:9c:c9:b8:60:1f:fe:1c:d3:8a root@here
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
|       +         |
|      o S   .    |
|     o   . * +   |
|      o + = O .  |
|       + = = +   |
|      ....Eo+    |
+-----------------+
This procedure has generated an RSA SSH key pair located in the .ssh hidden directory within your user’s home directory. These files are:

~/.ssh/id_rsa: The private key. DO NOT SHARE THIS FILE!
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub: The associated public key. This can be shared freely without consequence.
Note: You can refer to our guide on Creating SSH keys with OpenSSH on macOS or Windows Subsystem.

Generate an SSH Key Pair with a Larger Number of Bits
SSH keys are 2048 bits by default. This is generally considered to be good enough for security, but you can specify a greater number of bits for a more hardened key.

To do this, include the -b argument with the number of bits you would like. Most servers support keys with a length of at least 4096 bits. Longer keys may not be accepted for DDOS protection purposes:

ssh-keygen -b 4096
If you had previously created a different key, you will be asked if you wish to overwrite your previous key:

Overwrite (y/n)?
If you choose “yes”, your previous key will be overwritten and you will no longer be able to log in to servers using that key. Because of this, be sure to overwrite keys with caution.

Removing or Changing the Passphrase on a Private Key
If you have generated a passphrase for your private key and wish to change or remove it, you can do so easily.

Note: To change or remove the passphrase, you must know the original passphrase. If you have lost the passphrase to the key, there is no recourse and you will have to generate a new key pair.

To change or remove the passphrase, simply type:

ssh-keygen -p
Enter file in which the key is (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
You can type the location of the key you wish to modify or press ENTER to accept the default value:

Enter old passphrase:
Enter the old passphrase that you wish to change. You will then be prompted for a new passphrase:

Enter new passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Here, enter your new passphrase or press ENTER to remove the passphrase.

Displaying the SSH Key Fingerprint
Each SSH key pair share a single cryptographic “fingerprint” which can be used to uniquely identify the keys. This can be useful in a variety of situations.

To find out the fingerprint of an SSH key, type:

ssh-keygen -l
Enter file in which the key is (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
You can press ENTER if that is the correct location of the key, else enter the revised location. You will be given a string which contains the bit-length of the key, the fingerprint, and account and host it was created for, and the algorithm used:

Output
4096 8e:c4:82:47:87:c2:26:4b:68:ff:96:1a:39:62:9e:4e  demo@test (RSA)
Copying your Public SSH Key to a Server with SSH-Copy-ID
To copy your public key to a server, allowing you to authenticate without a password, a number of approaches can be taken.

If you currently have password-based SSH access configured to your server, and you have the ssh-copy-id utility installed, this is a simple process. The ssh-copy-id tool is included in many Linux distributions’ OpenSSH packages, so it very likely may be installed by default.

If you have this option, you can easily transfer your public key by typing:

ssh-copy-id username@remote_host
This will prompt you for the user account’s password on the remote system:

The authenticity of host '111.111.11.111 (111.111.11.111)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is fd:fd:d4:f9:77:fe:73:84:e1:55:00:ad:d6:6d:22:fe.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
demo@111.111.11.111's password:
After typing in the password, the contents of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub key will be appended to the end of the user account’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file:

Output
Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'demo@111.111.11.111'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
You can now log in to that account without a password:

ssh username@remote_host
Copying your Public SSH Key to a Server Without SSH-Copy-ID
If you do not have the ssh-copy-id utility available, but still have password-based SSH access to the remote server, you can copy the contents of your public key in a different way.

You can output the contents of the key and pipe it into the ssh command. On the remote side, you can ensure that the ~/.ssh directory exists, and then append the piped contents into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh username@remote_host "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
You will be asked to supply the password for the remote account:

The authenticity of host '111.111.11.111 (111.111.11.111)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is fd:fd:d4:f9:77:fe:73:84:e1:55:00:ad:d6:6d:22:fe.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
demo@111.111.11.111's password:
After entering the password, your key will be copied, allowing you to log in without a password:

ssh username@remote_IP_host
Copying your Public SSH Key to a Server Manually
If you do not have password-based SSH access available, you will have to add your public key to the remote server manually.

On your local machine, you can find the contents of your public key file by typing:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Output
ssh-rsa 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 demo@test
You can copy this value, and manually paste it into the appropriate location on the remote server. You will have to log in to the remote server through other means (like the DigitalOcean web console).

On the remote server, create the ~/.ssh directory if it does not already exist:

mkdir -p ~/.ssh
Afterwards, you can create or append the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file by typing:

echo public_key_string >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
You should now be able to log in to the remote server without a password.

Basic Connection Instructions
The following section will cover some of the basics about how to connect to a server with SSH.

Connecting to a Remote Server
To connect to a remote server and open a shell session there, you can use the ssh command.

The simplest form assumes that your username on your local machine is the same as that on the remote server. If this is true, you can connect using:

ssh remote_host
If your username is different on the remoter server, you need to pass the remote user’s name like this:

ssh username@remote_host
Your first time connecting to a new host, you will see a message that looks like this:

The authenticity of host '111.111.11.111 (111.111.11.111)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is fd:fd:d4:f9:77:fe:73:84:e1:55:00:ad:d6:6d:22:fe.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Type yes to accept the authenticity of the remote host.

If you are using password authentication, you will be prompted for the password for the remote account here. If you are using SSH keys, you will be prompted for your private key’s passphrase if one is set, otherwise you will be logged in automatically.

Running a Single Command on a Remote Server
To run a single command on a remote server instead of spawning a shell session, you can add the command after the connection information, like this:

ssh username@remote_host command_to_run
This will connect to the remote host, authenticate with your credentials, and execute the command you specified. The connection will immediately close afterwards.

Logging in to a Server with a Different Port
By default the SSH daemon on a server runs on port 22. Your SSH client will assume that this is the case when trying to connect. If your SSH server is listening on a non-standard port (this is demonstrated in a later section), you will have to specify the new port number when connecting with your client.

You can do this by specifying the port number with the -p option:

ssh -p port_num username@remote_host
To avoid having to do this every time you log in to your remote server, you can create or edit a configuration file in the ~/.ssh directory within the home directory of your local computer.

Edit or create the file now by typing:

nano ~/.ssh/config
In here, you can set host-specific configuration options. To specify your new port, use a format like this:

~/.ssh/config
Host remote_alias
    HostName remote_host
    Port port_num
This will allow you to log in without specifying the specific port number on the command line.

Adding your SSH Keys to an SSH Agent to Avoid Typing the Passphrase
If you have a passphrase on your private SSH key, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase every time you use it to connect to a remote host.

To avoid having to repeatedly do this, you can run an SSH agent. This small utility stores your private key after you have entered the passphrase for the first time. It will be available for the duration of your terminal session, allowing you to connect in the future without re-entering the passphrase.

This is also important if you need to forward your SSH credentials (shown later).

To start the SSH Agent, type the following into your local terminal session:

eval $(ssh-agent)
Output
Agent pid 10891
This will start the agent program and place it into the background. Now, you need to add your private key to the agent, so that it can manage your key:

ssh-add
Enter passphrase for /home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa:
Identity added: /home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa)
You will have to enter your passphrase (if one is set). Afterwards, your identity file is added to the agent, allowing you to use your key to sign in without having to re-enter the passphrase again.

Forwarding your SSH Credentials to Use on a Server
If you wish to be able to connect without a password to one server from within another server, you will need to forward your SSH key information. This will allow you to authenticate to another server through the server you are connected to, using the credentials on your local computer.

To start, you must have your SSH agent started and your SSH key added to the agent (see earlier). After this is done, you need to connect to your first server using the -A option. This forwards your credentials to the server for this session:

ssh -A username@remote_host
From here, you can SSH in to any other host that your SSH key is authorized to access. You will connect as if your private SSH key were located on this server.

Server-Side Configuration Options
This section contains some common server-side configuration options that can shape the way that your server responds and what types of connections are allowed.

Disabling Password Authentication
If you have SSH keys configured, tested, and working properly, it is probably a good idea to disable password authentication. This will prevent any user from signing in with SSH using a password.

To do this, connect to your remote server and open the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file with root or sudo privileges:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Inside of the file, search for the PasswordAuthentication directive. If it is commented out, uncomment it. Set it to no to disable password logins:

/etc/ssh/sshd_config
PasswordAuthentication no
After you have made the change, save and close the file. To implement the changes, you should restart the SSH service.

On Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo service ssh restart
On CentOS/Fedora:

sudo service sshd restart
Now, all accounts on the system will be unable to log in with SSH using passwords.

Changing the Port that the SSH Daemon Runs On
Some administrators suggest that you change the default port that SSH runs on. This can help decrease the number of authentication attempts your server is subjected to from automated bots.

To change the port that the SSH daemon listens on, you will have to log in to your remote server. Open the sshd_config file on the remote system with root privileges, either by logging in with that user or by using sudo:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Once you are inside, you can change the port that SSH runs on by finding the Port 22 specification and modifying it to reflect the port you wish to use. For instance, to change the port to 4444, put this in your file:

/etc/ssh/sshd_config
#Port 22
Port 4444
Save and close the file when you are finished. To implement the changes, you must restart the SSH daemon.

On Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo service ssh restart
On CentOS/Fedora:

sudo service sshd restart
After the daemon restarts, you will need to authenticate by specifying the port number (demonstrated in an earlier section).

Limiting the Users Who can Connect Through SSH
To explicitly limit the user accounts who are able to log in through SSH, you can take a few different approaches, each of which involve editing the SSH daemon config file.

On your remote server, open this file now with root or sudo privileges:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
The first method of specifying the accounts that are allowed to login is using the AllowUsers directive. Search for the AllowUsers directive in the file. If one does not exist, create it anywhere. After the directive, list the user accounts that should be allowed to login through SSH:
